# javascript-challenge-password-generator

## Description

This assignment is to fix the Javascript code to make the Password Generator generate a random password. I built this project to help understand how certain variables and functions work. In order to ensure the functions work I had to check the console section of the development tool. The console will inform which line in VS Code needed to be corrected. I learned the importance of checking the console and using "console.log".

## Installation

The first step is to check the existing code and determine what is missing in the functions. Next step is to add the variables that connect with the functions. Next, I worked on activating the "generate password" button and added another function with the event listener function. Then, I created confirm prompts to allow the user to follow the specifics needed to generate a password. I made sure to check the dev tools console of any existing errors and to ensure the functions worked.

## Usage

The user will start by clicking the "Generate Password" button. The user will be prompted to select the number of characters desired. Password length must be within 8 to 128. After selecting the qualifying length, the user will be asked to confirm if uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters are desired in the generated password. The new generated password will display on the display box.

## Credits

I would like to credit the Coding Bootcamp Instructor that provided examples of codes used for the Burrito Makr. I would also like to thank a youtube tutorial assistance video by Daniel Vega.
